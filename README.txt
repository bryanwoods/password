password: brain-dead simple password storage

== DESCRIPTION:
  
password is a simple command-line tool to store your INESSENTIAL passwords.

All passwords stored with password are stored as plain text in a file called
".they_stole_my_facebook_login_oh_noez" in your home directory.

If you store vitally essential personal information using password, you are a
dumb motherfucker. (Or, at least, much braver than smart.)

password exists because I could not give a flying fuck if somebody steals my
Twitter login and because I discovered research which indicates removing
registration requirements from online communities actually IMPROVES the
signal-to-noise ratio, consistently, by a nontrivial margin.

OpenID is not the solution. Not giving a fuck is the solution. Therefore I
present password - the crucial tool for people who don't give a fuck.

== CODE EXAMPLES:

  password -g twitter
  password --get twitter

Prints your Twitter username and password to the terminal.

  password -a

Prints every known username/password combo to the terminal.

  password -s twitter wilbur s3cr3t
  password --set twitter wilbur s3cr3t

Sets your password entry for "twitter" to username "wilbur" and password
"s3cr3t".

  password -G twitter wilbur
  password --generating_set twitter wilbur

Sets your password entry for "twitter" to username "wilbur" and a 10-digit
autogenerated password, and prints the new username/password combo.

  password -l 23 -G twitter wilbur
  password --length 23 --generating_set twitter wilbur

Sets your password entry for "twitter" to username "wilbur" and a 23-digit
autogenerated password, and prints the new username/password combo.

All password really does is store a hash as YAML, so if you store a password
as "twitter" you won't be able to retrieve it as "Twitter." That's the bad
news; the good news is that if you really care about security, you can use
nicknames for sites, instead of their literal names, and combine that with
password's ability to create arbitrary-length autogenerated random passwords.

You could even do this:

  password -l 235_000 -G username_for_site_that_joe_told_me_about_that_one_day_at_the_ramen_place x
  password -l 235_000 -G password_for_site_that_joe_told_me_about_that_one_day_at_the_ramen_place x

The output would be:

  username_for_site_that_joe_told_me_about_that_one_day_at_the_ramen_place
    username: x
    password: [235,000-character randomly-generated string]
  password_for_site_that_joe_told_me_about_that_one_day_at_the_ramen_place
    username: x
    password: [235,000-character randomly-generated string]

Blam. Usernames and passwords that can stand up to rainbow hashes. Secure forever
against everybody but Joe, and whoever you guys went to the ramen place with that
one day. (And maybe your waiter or waitress, depending on the status of their
eavesdropping skills.)
